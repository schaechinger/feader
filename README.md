## Introduction

feader was the topic of my bachelor thesis. The goal was to create an open source feed reader that is web based with responsive design to be available on every device at any time.
It reads all kinds of feeds in the formats rss and atom.

There is still much to do and I do not have the time to improve it at the moment so feel free to reuse the code and enhance it.

A short description of the database config and tables will follow shortly.
